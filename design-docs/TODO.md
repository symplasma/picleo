# TODO

- Need to ensure that lines do not mess up display via multi-width chars or other odd bytes e.g. when asked to take the head of binary files
- Ensure that displayed lines fit within the space alloted
- Remove quotes from string in preview window
- Add autocomplete function which takes a lambda
- Run preview on initial match
- Update match as indexing completes
