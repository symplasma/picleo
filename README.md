# Picleo

A fuzzy picker/matcher CLI using [nucleo](https://crates.io/crates/nucleo).

Picleo was inspired by and is most similar to [nucleo-picker](https://lib.rs/crates/nucleo-picker) but with different/expanded functionality e.g. selection of multiple items, and adding non-existing items to the "selection" that should be created.

Additionally, this crate is a test for AI coding using [Aider](https://aider.chat/) and Claude 3.7 (at least initially).

## Status

This is currently **pre-alpha** phase software. It is very feature incomplete compared to [Skim](https://lib.rs/crates/skim), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), and other fuzzy finders.

The current development focus is on integrating this into a larger project as a selector widget. As such, it's unlikely to gain feature parity with other CLI fuzzy finders in the near future.
